    <h1 class="titlex">Goals for 2022</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of 2022 I decided to set some goals in order to keep myself accountable and to stretch myself. I
      have never been good with goals, nor do I consider myself to be still, but I am trying. </p>
    <h2 class="goalss">Goal 1</h2>
    <p>The first goal I had was to read a little bit of the scriptures in spanish every single day. I have a brother on
      a mission who is currently learning spanish, so I know that reading in spanish will help me not lose that, as well
      as just helping me keep up my spirituality. </p>
    <h2 class="goalss">Goal 2</h2>
    <p>My second goal was to wake up everyday before 8:30 am. Not going to lie this has been a hard one. I can say with
      100% certainty that I have "woken up" before 8:30 am, but getting up before this time is a completely different
      story. I really want to master my morning, because I know that it will lead to increased productivity. </p>
    <h2 class="goalss">Goal 3</h2>
    <p>The third goal I had was to get a job. This is actually something that I have accomplished. I am currently
      working at Thread Wallets in their finance department. It has been a great experience. They are super great over
      there and they are very flexible with me working while also a full-time student. </p>
    <h2 class="goalss">Goal 4</h2>
    <p>The last goal that I had for this year was to get a 4.0 in my classes. Right now I am doing pretty well. I will
      have to update you at the end of the semester to let you know how it goes. My hardest class at the moment is
      Finance and I spend a lot of time on it every week. Hopefully I can put in the work to get the grades that I
      desire.</p>
