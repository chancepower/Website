    <h1>Investing</h1>

    <p>The moment that I turned 18 I became eligible to start investing and trading stocks. I really liked the idea of
      letting my money grow instead of sit in the bank and nearly no interest. I started my Robinhood account and became
      super interested. In the beginning I was trying to do a lot of trading to make short term gains all while trying
      to
      time the market. Let's just say it was not such a great strategy. I started reading and learning from other famous
      investors and learned that there is a difference between trading and investing and they are two completely
      different
      things. Now the majority of my money is invested in index funds and a few other stocks I feel like could have
      potential to grow. Below I will list them and tell a little about them.

        <p>Not to rant at all, but Alibaba was not a so good stock purchase. When I purchased it was at its all time low
          at around $200. The novice investor in me said" it is low it has to go up". Well... Let's Just say that did
          not happen and it has been on a long ride to the bottom of the rollercoaster. I am really hoping that we are
          going to hit the bottom soon and begin the climb up. Only time will tell. </p>

      <img class="investingwrapper" src="../images/hood.jpg" alt="">
      <p>I bought shares in Robinhood at its IPO. The next day when the market opened it went crazy! Shares stated at
        $45 and within an hour of the market opening they were up to $85. Most exchanges had to halt trading. Robinhood
        was still allowing it and I was about to cash out at $80 a share, but then my parents told me to just hold on
        for the long run. Listening to my parents was a big mistake to say the least. As of now Robinhood is trading at
        $25 a share. It was a big "L" to say the least</p>
