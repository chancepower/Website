  <h1>Investing</h1>
  <p>The moment that I turned 18 I became eligible to start investing and trading stocks. I really liked the idea of
    letting my money grow instead of sit in the bank and nearly no interest. I started my Robinhood account and became
    super interested. In the beginning I was trying to do a lot of trading to make short term gains all while trying to
    time the market. Let's just say it was not such a great strategy. I started reading and learning from other famous
    investors and learned that there is a difference between trading and investing and they are two completely different
    things. Now the majority of my money is invested in index funds and a few other stocks I feel like could have
    potential to grow. Below I will list them and tell a little about them.

    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
    <h3>VOO</h3>
    <p>VOO is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and it tracks the market-cap weighted index of US large-cap and mid-cap stocks
      selected by the S&P Committee. This index fund is primarily tech heavy. </p>
