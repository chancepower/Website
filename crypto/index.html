    <h1 class="tiitlex">Crypto</h1>
    <p>I guess you could say that I too have been caught up in the craze of crypto currencies. Once you get past all of
      the
      "crypto gurus" and all of the "get rich quick" schemes the technology behind it is actually pretty great.
      <h2 class="goalss">Story Time</h2>
      <p>While I was home from my mission everyone was going crazy one "meme coins". I decided to join the fun. Let's
        just
        say that I am a very risk calculated person. I do not enjoy risk and it is hard to waste away hard earned money.
        I
        bought a stock in Robinhood and has $.30 left over. I decided to invest it into Doge Coin. After I got back in
        July
        of 2021 my $.30 turned into $50. It was insane. Luckily I pulled out and became just a little bit richer. </p>
    </p>

    <h2 class="goalss">Ethereum</h2>
    <p>This is a coin I am very invested in and I think has a lot of potential.
      Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and
      verifies application code, called smart contracts. Smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other
      without a trusted central authority.</p>

    <h2 class="goalss">Polygon</h2>
    <p>Polygon is a cryptocurrency, with the symbol MATIC, and also a technology platform that enables blockchain
      networks
      to connect and scale. Polygon—"Ethereum's internet of blockchains"— launched under the name Matic Network in 2017.
      The
      Polygon platform operates using the Ethereum blockchain, and connects Ethereum-based projects. Using the Polygon
      platform can increase the flexibility, scalability, and sovereignty of a blockchain project while still affording
      the
      security, interoperability, and structural benefits of the Ethereum blockchain. </p>
