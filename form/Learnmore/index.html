    <h1>My Mission</h1>

    <p>Back in the spring of 2019 I decided to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This
      would mean that I would leave my family for 2 years in order to teach others about Christ and serve them. I
      submitted my mission papers and around April of 2019 I opened up my mission call. I was called to serve in the
      Mexico Puebla South Mission. I was incredibly excited. Words cannot describe. I was assigned to report to the
      Mexico
      City Missionary Training center on September 3, 2019. </p>
    <div class="readingwrapper"> <img class="imagez" src="../../images/missioncallopening.jpg"
        alt="My mission call opening. "></div>

    <p>I got to Mexico City and it was a full swing of emotions, I was in Mexico City, one of the most dangerous places
      in
      the world, I had no form of talking to my family, and I was trying to learn a language that made no sense to me. I
      was there for 6 weeks and made some amazing friends, but it was truly very hard. </p>
    <img class="pictures4mission" src="../../images/mapmtc.JPG" alt="A picture of me in the MTC pointing at Puebla.">
    <p>After the 6 weeks in the MTC were over I finally made it to Puebla. Puebla is the next sate over from the state
      of
      Mexico City. It sits at about 7,000 feet above sea level. It has a nice temperate weather (depending on where you
      are at) and has a nice big active Volcano that you can see. It is beautiful. My first area that I was assigned to
      serve in was called "La Margarita" in the city. It was very hard to adjust and learn spanish, but I got the hang
      of
      it right after a while. We lived in a very humble house that was literally made of cinder blocks that was built
      above the house of a local member of the church. I had an amazing trainer from Colorado named Evan Bartholio. He
      was
      great and he made a huge
      impact on my life. During those 12 weeks together we talked to thousands of people and made some amazing friends,
      and helped so many people come unto Christ. </p>

    <img class="pictures4mission" src="../../images/humblehome.jpg" alt="">
    <p>After those 12 weeks. I got a new companion named Zeniff Iglesias from Tamaulipas, Mexico. He had lived in the
      United States for about 8 years, therefore he knew how to speak english very well. His Uncle was in the Cartel and
      their family was forced to leave to another part of Mexico because of that. He was one of my favorite companions.
      When he spoke spanish he was so mature, but when he spoke english it was like the kid was 12. It was like he was
      two
      different people. When I was with Elder Iglesias we found Ramon. Ramon was about 70 years old an he was in a
      wheeled
      chair, because both of his legs were amputated due to diabetes. He had no family and needed so much help. We
      taught
      him about Jesus Christ and the plan that God has for us and he started crying and instantly came to accept it. He
      was baptized 8 days later. We then got to take him to the temple in Mexico City to do baptisms for his parents. It
      was so special and I miss him so much! </p>

    <p>After my 18 weekns in La MArgarita I got my transfer calls. It was to a very far off "pueblito" or little town
      out
      in the middle of the desert called Acatl√°n de Osorio. It was a 4 hour bus ride away and it was very hot. I was
      sweating constantly. This area was a very hard one, but we met Martha! An amazing women who worked with a local
      member of the church and wanted to be taught about the Gospel. Right as we were teaching her COVID started and we
      had no idea what was coming. </p>

    </div>

    <p>Shortly after the baptism of Martha we found out the pandemic had gotten so bad that all countries were starting
      to
      shut their borders and we would have to return back to the United States and wait for reassignments to finish out
      our missions. It was crazy to go home after 7 months of not seeing my family.
    </p>
    <img class="pictures4mission" src="../../images/leavingmexico.JPG" alt="Me leaving Mexico due to the pandemic. ">
    <p>I was home for about 5 months waiting to get reassigned. I finally received my reassignment to The New York
      Syracuse Mission. While I was at home I got to enjoy time with my family and I worked. </p>
    <img class="pictures4mission" src="../../images/enjoyinglife.jpg" alt="Just enjoying life back home.">
    <p>On September 14, 2020 I finally made it to New York. I was assigned to serve in Watertown which is about 30
      minutes
      south of Canada. It is very cold up there and located right next to one of great lakes. I was there through the
      dead
      of winter. I cannot even begin to explain the miracles that happened while in New York, but they were incredible.
      I
      met so many people and felt so man lives change for the better. Here are some pictures:</p>

    <p>At the end of my time in Watertown I got a call from my mission president saying that I was going back to Mexico.
      I
      was so excited! I got to reunite with all my buddies that I started my mission with.</p>
