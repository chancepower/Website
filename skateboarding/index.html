  <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
  <p>At the age of 6 years old I started skateboarding and it was probably the best thing to happen to me. I remember it
    vividly. My Dad got me a skateboard for my 6th birthday and I can remember riding it in the garage of our new house.
    Two years later for Christmas my Dad built me a half-pipe in our backyard. It was a skater's dream. I spent
    thousands of hours out on that ramp. At age 8 I entered my first competition at the local skate park. I had
    aspirations to win it, but my skills were not at the level that they needed to be at. Over the next year I devoted
    myself to skateboarding in order to do better in the contest the next year. By the time that the contest came around
    I got 1st place and it started my addiction. From there on I started to skateboard at a competitive level. I was
    doing so many contests and I was winning the majority of them. I was competing against kids that would go on to
    skate board in the olympics. I loved it.
