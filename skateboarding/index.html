    <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>At the age of 6 years old I started skateboarding and it was probably the best thing to happen to me. I remember
      it
      vividly. My Dad got me a skateboard for my 6th birthday and I can remember riding it in the garage of our new
      house.
      Two years later for Christmas my Dad built me a half-pipe in our backyard. It was a skater's dream. I spent
      thousands of hours out on that ramp. At age 8 I entered my first competition at the local skate park. I had
      aspirations to win it, but my skills were not at the level that they needed to be at. Over the next year I devoted
      myself to skateboarding in order to do better in the contest the next year. By the time that the contest came
      around
      I got 1st place and it started my addiction. From there on I started to skateboard at a competitive level. I was
      doing so many contests and I was winning the majority of them. I was competing against kids that would go on to
      skate board in the olympics. I loved it.

    <p>After 4 years of skating and training I started to get burnt out. I felt myself not enjoying it anymore and I
      just felt a lot of pressure. I had many long periods in my life when I would not skateboard. Eventually I found
      out that when I felt stressed in life skateboarding is what helped me to feel better. I still continue to
      skateboard today, but not at the competitive level that I used to. Many opportunities have come to me in life
      through skating including skateboarding for company's marketing campaigns. </p>
